# Sleepy

## What is it ?
Sleepy is a fantasy football helper tool for people playing under the [sleeper app](https://sleeper.app).
#####
It is most beneficial for players with __multiple__ leagues.
#####
It aggregates all of your league matchups into a single view,
so you could see clearly who to root for and who to root against in each game/timeslot.
#####
In addition, it shows you all players in which you are in a rooting conflict since a player can have "Player A" on "League X" but be in a matchup against him in "League Y"
#####

## How ?
This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack.
#####
Next.js with tailwind css for the frontend portion of the project fitted me great so I went with that,
this was my first experience with Prisma, trpc and Plantscale to scaffold the backend part of the app.
#####
This project also allowed me to touch on new app-developing aspects like Google Analytics incorporation and github workflows to manage my daily DB refreshes.


## Adoption
The tool became popular on Reddit: [(1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/xbaz24/free_sleeper_tool_hard_to_keep_up_with_too_many/),  [(2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SleeperApp/comments/xarvhp/free_sleeper_tool_hard_to_keep_up_with_too_many/), [(3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootballcoding/comments/xbapms/free_sleeper_tool_hard_to_keep_up_with_too_many/)
#####
Per Google Analytics the app got around 1.9K users in its first season.

## What's next ?
For next season I want to finally add the feature of Roots vs. Boos with a scaling option (e.g., "League X" is more valuable to me than "League Y" so root their players more), have overall better performance, better UX/UI, enabling PWA and hopefully more.
